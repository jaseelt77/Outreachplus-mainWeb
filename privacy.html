               <h1 class="title">Privacy Policy</h1>
               <div class="et_pb_text_inner">
                  <p>At OutreachPlus if you register as a customer or an email subscriber we store your data.&nbsp; But we also have a SaaS application where we store data on behalf of our customers and this includes some personal data.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>From a GDPR point of view (European legislation for the protection of data) we are both a data controller and a data processor.</p>
                  <p>The following outlines our privacy policy which covers data protection for GDPR and other data protection laws.</p>
                  <p>Your privacy is very important to us.&nbsp;At OutreachPlus we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
                     <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                     <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>OutreachPlus Ltd (“OutreachPlus”) operates several websites including OutreachPlus.com It is OutreachPlus’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
                  <p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>
                  <p>Like most website operators, OutreachPlus collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OutreachPlus’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OutreachPlus’s visitors use its website. From time to time, OutreachPlus may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                  <p>OutreachPlus also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. OutreachPlus only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
                  <p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
                  <p>Certain visitors to OutreachPlus’s websites choose to interact with OutreachPlus in ways that require OutreachPlus to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that OutreachPlus gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive OutreachPlus updates via email, we collect their emails. For example, when you to sign up for an account, we ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. When visitors comment on our blog, we ask them to provide a username and email address. For those who wish to receive OutreachPlus updates via email, we collect their emails.</p>
                  <p>In each case, OutreachPlus collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with OutreachPlus. OutreachPlus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                  <p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></p>
                  <p>OutreachPlus may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, OutreachPlus may monitor the most popular pages on the OutreachPlus.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. OutreachPlus may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, OutreachPlus does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                  <p><strong>Information We Share</strong></p>
                  <p>OutreachPlus discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on OutreachPlus’s behalf or to provide services available at OutreachPlus’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using OutreachPlus’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.</p>
                  <p>OutreachPlus will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
                  <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, OutreachPlus discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when OutreachPlus believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of OutreachPlus, third parties or the public at large.</p>
                  <p>If you are a registered user of an OutreachPlus website and have supplied your email address, OutreachPlus may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with OutreachPlus and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.</p>
                  <p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</p>
                  <p>OutreachPlus takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information, as discussed below.</p>
                  <p><strong>Information Security</strong></p>
                  <p>We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, in particular:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</li>
                     <li>We review our information collection, storage, and processing procedures, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
                     <li>We restrict access to personal information to OutreachPlus employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OutreachPlus uses cookies to help OutreachPlus identify and track visitors, their usage of OutreachPlus website, and their website access preferences. OutreachPlus visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OutreachPlus’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of OutreachPlus’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                  <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong></p>
                  <p>If OutreachPlus, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that OutreachPlus goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of OutreachPlus may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
                  <p><strong>Ads</strong></p>
                  <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by OutreachPlus and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                  <p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
                  <p>Comments and other content submitted to Disqus anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>
                  <p><strong>When this Privacy Policy Applies</strong></p>
                  <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by OutreachPlus and its affiliates, including services OutreachPlus provides on mobile devices, and services offered on other sites, but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
                  <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including other sites linked to our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>
                  <p><strong>Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</strong></p>
                  <p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>
                  <p><strong>Collection of data through our SaaS application</strong></p>
                  <p>As a customer of OutreachPlus you have the ability to store personal data of your customers.&nbsp; We do our best to ensure this data is held securely at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; We follow the same privacy guidelines in this document for our app also.</p>
                  <p><strong>As well as storing data on behalf of customers we enable customers to connect to their email of choice to allow them to send emails through OutreachPlus.&nbsp; This is also data we have access to that we protect and keep private.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>Right to erasure of data</strong></p>
                  <p>At any time any of our customers or subscribers have the right to remove any data that we have stored.&nbsp; An email to <a href="mailto:support@outreachplus.com">support@outreachplus.com</a> will start this process.</p>
                  <p><strong>Advice to our customers</strong></p>
                  <p>We advice all our customers not to store any data unnecessarily for periods longer than required and we provide facilities for removing such data from our app.</p>
                  <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></p>
                  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, OutreachPlus may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in OutreachPlus’s sole discretion. OutreachPlus encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
